# Git Workflow Guide

## Branch Management

Based on our project requirements, we adopt the following branch management strategy:

1. **master** - Main branch containing the latest development code
2. **released** - Release branch, contains stable production code
3. **pre-release** - Pre-release branch for testing and validation before release
4. **feature/** - Feature branch, created from master for new features
5. **fix/** - Bugfix branch, used for fixing issues
6. **refactor/** - Refactor branch, used for code refactoring

## Branch Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create a feature branch from master: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature master`
   - Develop and commit code on the feature branch
   - Upon completion, create a Merge Request to merge into master branch

2. **Bug Fixing**
   - Create a fix branch from master or released: `git checkout -b fix/issue-123 master`
   - Fix bugs and commit code
   - Upon completion, create a Merge Request to merge into the appropriate branch

3. **Version Release Process**
   - Update pre-release from master: `git checkout pre-release && git merge master`
   - Perform final testing and adjustments on pre-release
   - After testing, update released: `git checkout released && git merge pre-release`
   - Tag the production release: `git tag v1.x.x`

## Commit Message Conventions

We adopt Emoji + type commit message conventions:

```
<emoji> <type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Emoji and type correspondence:
- `✨ feat`: New feature
- `🐛 fix`: Bug fix
- `📝 docs`: Documentation changes
- `💄 style`: Code format (does not affect code execution)
- `♻️ refactor`: Refactor (neither adding feature nor fixing bug)
- `⚡️ perf`: Performance optimization
- `✅ test`: Add tests
- `🔧 chore`: Build process or tooling changes

Example:
```
✨ feat: Introduce user selector component & replace user selection across group chat/schedule/flow permissions/agent visibility

- Refactored user selection logic to use unified @feb/user-selector component
- Improved user selection experience in group chat creation flow
- Support multi-dimensional search by department, name, etc.

Closes #456
```

## Code Review Standards

1. Run tests and lint checks before submitting code: `pnpm lint && pnpm test`
2. Add clear descriptions when creating a Merge Request
3. Code Review focus areas:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Performance impact
   - Security issues

## Development Process Checklist

- [ ] Created new branch from the correct base branch
- [ ] Followed coding standards and style guide
- [ ] Added appropriate unit tests
- [ ] Passed all tests and lint checks
- [ ] Commit messages follow Emoji + type convention
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
